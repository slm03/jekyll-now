For this project we were instructed to create a generative abstraction. We were to create a composition using assets we created, found, and coded. I decided to recreate a Scrabble playing board with tiles spelling out words and then creating short phrases. 

My idea came from wanting to use inspirational quotes that I personally enjoy, and I thought others would also enjoy them as well.
The idea behind recreating a Scrabble board was to add a little bit of hapiness and fun to my overall composition. If someone sees a Scrabble board it may remind them of memories they may have had playing the game. When I see it, it reminds me of a simpler time when I was young and used to play with my cousin, who was also my best friend. 

To begin, I decided to completely recreate a Scrabble board while using a photo of the board that I found at: https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/92055/draw-an-empty-scrabble-board - https://i.stack.imgur.com/0kZO8.jpg

I created this "playing board" using Adobe Photoshop. I used grids to make the squares throughout the board, then added text, colors, shapes, etc. I also used Photoshop to create the words/phrases with the game tiles, found at:

After I was finished making the board and adding the tiles, I created the assets and uploaded them to the p5.js Web Editor. Then I placed each asset where it was supposed to fit on the canvas. Then I used a random function to make a different phrase appear everytime the composition is ran!

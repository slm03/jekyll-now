For this project we were instructed to create 3 compositions transfiguring the body into geometrical shapes, or equivalently, a human sculpture. 

When I was growing up, my brothers and I always played sports. Because my dad always played baseball, we theoretically followed his footsteps. 
However, softball was the alternative for me considering I was a girl. Softball was never very popular when I was growing up, until I was about 
10 years old. I played coed baseball with my brothers until then, and then began my softball journey. I played through middle school, high school, 
even a few years in college. I found a huge love for this sport and I would've done anything to continue playing forever, as any athlete would.
I did end up getting injured in college so I was forced to retire from playing. But no worries, I am fine and I made the best memories and
formed friendships that will last forever!

Jennie Finch is an American Olympian and an extremely incredible role model. She is the best softball pitcher that has ever been, and arumentably 
the best in the sport all around. So, when I started this assignment I decided to use her in all-out mid-pitching motion to display the figure 
of the human body. This image shows the complexity of the sport and hopefully teaches the ones who are ignorant of the sport, or think it is "easy."
This sport is anything BUT easy and for anyone who disagrees I have video proof! 

So, let's move on. To begin this project I found some images on google of Finch pitching. 

background I used:

I chose to use a different photo than what was shown in the first photo of the background I chose because I wanted a crisp, clear picture of her in full stride.
Then I used Photoshop to clonestamp Finch out of the background photo and placed the other cut out of her on top of my new background image. 
I generated image assets and then uploaded the assets onto the p5.js Web Editor. I placed them at the correct coordinates, and then began the first composition.
In the Web Editor we used the "beginShape();" function to create geometrical shapes to form the figure of the body. 

(Being that we play softball on a diamond, of course I decided to create her form with diamonds. (; ) 

After hours of staring at coordinates and finding the right place for each diamond, the first composition was complete.

Onto the second. 
For the second composition we were to use bezier curves in or outside of the figure. I sketched out each pitching motion and then drew curves over them to
each motion we go through as softball pitchers. This called for the "bezierVertex()" function, which saved my life compared to our other "bezier()" function, 
where we are forced to find each coordinate manually and hard code them in.

For the third composition we were to use both straight lines and curves, but we were now allowed to use color. I combined the first and second compositions
and added some fill and stroke to the diamonds to create a sort of abstract scuplture if you will. I had a lot of fun with this one!

To incorporate the button to switch to a new composition I did exactly that. I created a button as well as a switch function that would move from one composition
to the next and then reset to the default image, which was just the original image I uploaded.
All in all I'm pleased with the way this turned out!

Welcome to Project 3!

For this one, we had to create a 2.5D Virtual Environment using parallaxing. We also had to create all of our own
assets.

I specifically had and idea to create a bedroom that had "no walls." I gave the intention of walls but created
the outside world beyond them. I started out with a skecth of how exactly I wanted this thing to look.

For my parallax, I wanted the composition to start at night and transition into day. I began by trying to use the
Editor to design everything, which ended up not being the best solution. So, I used Photoshop to create a night
scene and a day scene, along with the bedroom scene and combined them. 

After completing the scene, I uploaded the images into the Web Editor and created the parallax effect displayed.

There is not much to say about this project, mainly just to show!
